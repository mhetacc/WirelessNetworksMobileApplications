      - GPT4: near AGI <sub> Bubeck et al. (2023) examine GPT-4, highlighting its near- human capabilities across multiple disciplines, indicating a move towards artificial general intelligence (AGI) . GPT-4 emerges as a frontrunner among a new generation of LLMs, including ChatGPT and Google’s PaLM, demonstrating capa- bilities that closely mirror human intelligence across diverse fields such as mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, and psychology. GPT-4’s performance, superior to predecessors, showcases its versatility in solving novel tasks without specific prompts.
