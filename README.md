# AI Is Here To Stay: Misinformation and Human-Centric Models Between Risks and Opportunities

Survey report about AI on fake news and deepfakes generation and detection, opinion manipulation, AIs own biases and influenceability and AI for social impact.

## Abstract 

For more than half a century, artificial intelligence remained a matter of speculation for novelists and philosophers. This changed in 2017 due to the introduction of the transformer architecture, spearheading the AI boom whose effects are still scarcely understood.
This paper explores potential risks and use cases of this technology, with a "human-centric" cut: 
the first half showcases generation and detection of fake news and deepfakes, as well as how much LLMs can influence people's opinions and beliefs. The focus then shifts to the AIs themselves, about their own biases and their susceptibility to external stimuli, concluding with a quick overview on the state of research about AIs for positive social impact.
