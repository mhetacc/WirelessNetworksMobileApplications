%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography
%% files in BibTeX format.
%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,
%% or BibLaTeX with the acmnumeric or acmauthoryear sytles, that include
%% support for advanced citation of software artefact from the
%% biblatex-software package, also separately available on CTAN.
%%
%% Look at the sample-*-biblatex.tex files for templates showcasing
%% the biblatex styles.
%%

%%
%% The majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and
%% references.  The command \citestyle{authoryear} switches to the
%% "author year" style.
%%
%% If you are preparing content for an event
%% sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH, you must use the "author year" style of
%% citations and references.
%% Uncommenting
%% the next command will enable that style.

%%%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%%%% article.
%%\begin{abstract}
%%  The problem of {consensus in distributed systems} is both older than a millennium and more relevant than ever: {while in Lamport's imaginary island of Paxos} the challenge was to keep track of the many laws passed in a parliament where legislators had better to do than attend sessions full-time, nowadays the ubiquity of web-based architectures and applications (from a simple cloud storage to the whole banking system) gives daily headaches to developers and system administrators alike.
%%  {Aiming to solve this problem,} Ongaro and Ousterhout devised an easily understandable and implementable alternative to the Paxos algorithm, namely the Raft consensus algorithm, which we employ in this work to implement communication via XML-RPC between multiple Pygame applications, each running a game instance that aims to simulate a simplified version of a real-time strategy game.
