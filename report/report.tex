%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,

%%
%% The majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and

%%
%% If you are preparing content for an event
%% sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH, you must use the "author year" style of

%%%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%%%% article.
\begin{abstract}
For more than half a century, artificial intelligence remained a matter of speculation for novelists and philosophers. This changed in 2017 due to the introduction of the transformer architecture, spearheading the AI boom whose effects are still scarcely understood.
This paper explores potential risks and use cases of this technology, with a "human-centric" cut: 
the first half showcases generation and detection of fake news and deepfakes, as well as how much LLMs can influence people's opinions and beliefs. The focus then shifts to the AIs themselves, about their own biases and their susceptibility to external stimuli, concluding with a quick overview on the state of research about AIs for positive social impact.
