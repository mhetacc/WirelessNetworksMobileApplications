abstract = {Recent archaeological discoveries on the island of Paxos reveal that the parliament functioned despite the peripatetic propensity of its part-time legislators. The legislators maintained consistent copies of the parliamentary record, despite their frequent forays from the chamber and the forgetfulness of their messengers. The Paxon parliament's protocol provides a new way of implementing the state machine approach to the design of distributed systems.},

abstract = {To solve the problems of vote forgery and malicious election of candidate nodes in the Raft consensus algorithm, we combine zero trust with the Raft consensus algorithm and propose a secure and efficient consensus algorithm -Verifiable Secret Sharing Byzantine Fault Tolerance Raft Consensus Algorithm&nbsp;(VSSB-Raft). The VSSB-Raft consensus algorithm realizes zero trust through the supervisor node and secret sharing algorithm without the invisible trust between nodes required by the algorithm. Meanwhile, the VSSB-Raft consensus algorithm uses the SM2 signature algorithm to realize the characteristics of zero trust requiring authentication before data use. In addition, by introducing the NDN network, we redesign the communication between nodes and guarantee the communication quality among nodes. The VSSB-Raft consensus algorithm proposed in this paper can make the algorithm Byzantine fault tolerant by setting a threshold for secret sharing while maintaining the algorithm’s complexity to be O(n). Experiments show that the VSSB-Raft consensus algorithm is secure and efficient with high throughput and low consensus latency.},

abstract = {A protocol is presented which solves the randomized consensus problem [9] for shared memory. The protocol uses a total of O(p2 + n) worst-case expected increment, decrement, and read operations on a set of three shared O(log n)-bit counters, where p is the number of active processors and n is the total number of processors. It requires less space than previous polynomial-time consensus protocols [6, 7]. and is faster when not all of the processors participate in the protocol. A modified version of the protocol yields a weak shared coin whose bias is guaranteed to be in the range 1/2 ± ϵ regardless of scheduler behavior, and which is the first such protocol for the shared-memory model to guarantee that all processors agree on the outcome of the coin.}

abstract = {Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.},

abstract = {In view of the disadvantage that Raft algorithm does not have byzantine fault tolerance, this paper improves Raft algorithm and proposes a Raft algorithm with Byzantine fault tolerance – NRaft algorithm. First, NRaft algorithm uses the Shamir threshold secret sharing algorithm to solve the log tampering and information quantity fraud in Byzantine nodes; second, RSA encryption algorithm is used to further ensure the integrity of logs. Finally, the experimental data show that NRaft algorithm outperforms PBFT algorithm as the number of nodes increases. Therefore, the NRaft algorithm is not only suitable for environmentally secure private blockchain, but also for consortium blockchain where Byzantine nodes exist.},

abstract = {The classic textbook for computer systems analysis and design, Computer Organization and Design, has been thoroughly updated to provide a new focus on the revolutionary change taking place in industry today: the switch from uniprocessor to multicore microprocessors. This new emphasis on parallelism is supported by updates reflecting the newest technologies with examples highlighting the latest processor designs, benchmarking standards, languages and tools. As with previous editions, a MIPS processor is the core used to present the fundamentals of hardware technologies, assembly language, computer arithmetic, pipelining, memory hierarchies and I/O. Along with its increased coverage of parallelism, this new edition offers new content on Flash memory and virtual machines as well as a new and important appendix written by industry experts covering the emergence and importance of the modern GPU (graphics processing unit), the highly parallel, highly multithreaded multiprocessor optimized for visual computing.A new exercise paradigm allows instructors to reconfigure the 600 exercises included in the book to easily generate new exercises and solutions of their own. A CD provides a toolkit of simulators and compilers along with tutorials for using them as well as additional problems and solutions, and references.}
