\section{AI for Fake News Generation and Detection}
\label{sec:ai_fkns}

Fake news have rapidly become a significant concern in the modern digital age, thanks to their virality and potential damages. They spread faster and generate more engagement than truthful information \cite{kleinman_fake_2018,silverman_this_2016}, and can influence public opinion, manipulate elections and pose a threat to public health: the European Union issued guidelines to online platforms and search engines to mitigate the impact on misinformation on elections \cite{baccini_against_2024}, the World Economic forum has identified the proliferation of false content as the leading short-term global risk in 2025 \cite{carson_fake_2025}, and a BBC investigation found Russian-funded fake news networks aiming to disrupt european elections \cite{marocico_how_2025}. Moreover, fake news on health can cause psychological disorders and panic, fear, depression, and fatigue \cite{rocha_impact_2023}, and the World Health Organization called for the development of international fact-checking organizations to combat this phenomenon \cite{world_health_organization_1st_nodate}.

Adding to the problem, the recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have made it significantly easier to propagate disinformation throughout the web: generated content is increasingly indistinguishable from human-written text, sometimes even perceived as more credible \cite{kreps_all_2020}, citing true evidence to support false claims \cite{feng_syntactic_2012}, and inducing the illusion of majority opinion thanks to the sheer volume of information produced \cite{diresta_ai-generated_2020}.

%% deepfakes generation

Artificial agents can generate more than just text: they can create realistic images, videos and sounds, allowing them to reproduce digital twins of real or fictional people, known as deepfakes. In March 2019, such a technology has been used to trick a UK-based energy firm's CEO into transferring $\mathdollar 243{.}000$ to a convincingly mimicked company's German parent firm's CEO \cite{ferrara_genai_2024}. Deepfakes also increased the amount of conspiratorial videos on the internet, and they are especially vicious when targeting children, whose worldviews are easily swayed by deceptive—and highly photorealistic—content \cite{verma_one_2024}.

%% detection techniques

It follows that detecting and mitigating fake news is crucial, especially since the rise of AI-generated content has made disinformation easier to spread and more convincing. From the foundational work by Devlin et al. on \textit{BERT} in 2018 \cite{devlin_bert_2019}, which revolutionized natural language processing trough deep bidirectional transformers, to innovative detection models like \textit{exBAKE} and the application of transformers [TODO]
