\section{ai own biases and influenceability}
\label{sec:ai_biases}

Artificial agents are trained on a mostly human-generated data, so they learn human biases and tendencies themselves, developing both historical and political preferences in the textual content they generate \cite{roselli_managing_2019,rozado_political_2023,rozado_political_2024}. They tend to exhibit social sycophancy, by agreeing with and flattering the user at the cost of correctness \cite{cheng_elephant_2025}, and they are easily influenceable by small changes in prompt wording \cite{sclar_quantifying_2024, salinas_butterfly_2024}. This can be highly problematic as biased AIs can lead to discrimination or exclusion of marginalized groups, raising ethical concerns \cite{rosario_generative_1}.

Rozado, in the context of US politics, measured the political bias of popular large language models \cite{rozado_measuring_2025}. First, they calculated the similarity between AI-generated text and public speeches from Congress representatives (both Democrat and Republican). Then, they used an LLM to annotate as left- or right-leaning AI-generated policy recommendations. Consequently, they did a sentiment analysis on AI-generated comments about american public figures, such as legislators or journalists (figure \ref{fig:rozado_colors}), and lastly they administered three different political orientation tests to the various LLMs. The results show substantial evidence that popular large language models are biased and left-leaning. Table \ref{tab:rozado} shows the three most and three least biased LLMs among those tested.
