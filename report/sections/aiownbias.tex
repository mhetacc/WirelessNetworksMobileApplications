\section{ai own biases and influenceability}
\label{sec:ai_biases}

Artificial agents are trained on a mostly human-generated corpus of data, so they can develop biases and tendencies themselves.  They can develop both historical and political biases in the textual content they generate \cite{roselli_managing_2019,rozado_political_2023,rozado_political_2024}. They tend to exhibit social sycophancy, by agreeing with and flattering the user at the cost of correctness \cite{cheng_elephant_2025}, and they are easily influenceable by small changes in prompt wording \cite{sclar_quantifying_2024, salinas_butterfly_2024}. This can be highly problematic as it can lead to discrimination or exclude certain groups, raising ethical concerns \cite{rosario_generative_1}.
