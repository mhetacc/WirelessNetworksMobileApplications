\section{Introduction}

Artificial Intelligence has fascinated public and scientific community alike for almost a century, since Alan Turing's "Imitation Game" \cite{turing_computing_1950}. The idea, trivialized, is that any machine capable of fooling a person into thinking it's speaking to a human can be considered sentient. For seventy-three years the game has remained unbeaten, until OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 win in 2023 \cite{biever_chatgpt_2023}. This model is one of the last iterations of the Generative Pre-Training models pioneered by OpenAI in 2018 (at the moment of writing the latest model available is GPT-5.2) \cite{radford_improving_2018}, which closely followed the first breakthrough towards a human-like agents: "Attention Is All You Need" \cite{vaswani_attention_2017} is a 2017 landmark research paper authored by eight Google researchers that introduced the \textit{transformer} architecture, considered the backbone of all modern LLMs and the main contributor of the AI boom \cite{miller_artificial_2023}.
