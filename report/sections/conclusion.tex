This survey highlighted the opportunities and dangers posed by AI technologies, which must be managed and treated carefully since removing them from our society is, at this point, not an option. They can be used to recognize and combat problematics previously considered inattackable, such as fake news and hate speech, but they can just as much make said problems worse. They can influence the public opinion and absorb human tendencies and values from the data they are feeded.
This spurred entire reserearch fields to work torwards the develpoment of etichal and explainable AIs, to make sure that this technology help society instead than undermining it.
