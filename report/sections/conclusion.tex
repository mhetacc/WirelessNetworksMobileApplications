\section{conclusion}

This survey highlighted both opportunities and dangers posed by AI technologies, which must be carefully managed. They can be used to tackle challenges previously considered unassailable, such as fake news and hate speech detection, but they can just as much make them worse. They can analyze and mimic human behaviour to increase productivity and aid creativity, but they can also influence people's opinions and reduce their autonomy of judgment.
The consequences they can have upon society are so impactful that they spurred entire research fields towards the developments of ethical and explainable AIs, in the hope of harnessing the power of these technologies toward a better future.
